An Octave/Matlab + java script to visualise a GPS logged track on a Google map using the <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/static-maps/">Google Static Maps api</a>. I use it to visualise the logs I've recorded with my <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=timo.home.exercisepacer">Exercise Pacer</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=timo.home.gpsLog">GPS Logger</a> android apps.

To use 

Compile the java classes (requires <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/">java SDK</a> );
1) cd to java/src
2) javac timo/home/polyencode/PolyEncode.java
3) javac timo/home/seriesreducer/RDPReducer.java

Obtain a google static maps api key, and save it to a file named 'mapsKey.txt' in the root folder of the project (i.e. the folder with visualiseGPS.m). Just follow the procedure outlined on the google static maps webpage to obtain one.

Add some GPS log files into sampleData/gpsLog folder. I have included a sample file, which should show a route in the Melbourne Metropolitan area from Blackburn to Burwood.
