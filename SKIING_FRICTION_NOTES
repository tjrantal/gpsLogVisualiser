Pop the interesting file into extractTStamps.m, and inspect the data visually to identify the intersting bit for friction extraction (downhill for several seconds, no pyhsical acceleration or deceleration)
	Copy the information from command line to interestingEpoch.txt
	
Run model to optimise coefficient of rolling/sliding resistance, and coefficient of drag
	Evaluate physical work done based on the optimised rolling/sliding resistance and coefficient of drag
